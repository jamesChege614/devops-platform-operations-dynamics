# DevOps Governance and Platform Operations for Enterprise Dynamics Environment

## Overview

This project documents the DevOps governance, operational workflows and platform management practices implemented for an enterprise environment supporting Microsoft Dynamics-based business systems.

The environment included multiple interconnected components:

- Microsoft Dynamics NAV / Business Central
- Mobile banking applications
- Member portals
- Electronic Document Management Systems (EDMS)
- Reporting systems (Power BI)
- Supporting infrastructure and integrations

The objective was to ensure reliable system operation, controlled software delivery and structured environment management across development, testing and production stages.

---

## Objectives

- Establish environment governance across Dev, UAT and Production
- Implement structured release and change management processes
- Maintain backup and recovery discipline
- Support developer workflows and testing cycles
- Improve system reliability and operational stability
- Provide ongoing platform support and maintenance
- Reduce deployment risks and operational errors

---

## Environment Architecture

The platform operated across multiple environments:

- Development Environment
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Production Environment

Each environment served a specific purpose in the software delivery lifecycle, enabling controlled testing and safe deployments.

---

## DevOps Governance Practices

Key governance practices included:

- Environment separation and access controls
- Controlled release approval processes
- Change validation before production deployment
- Version and object backup management
- Deployment scheduling and coordination
- Risk mitigation procedures

These practices improved stability and reduced production incidents.

---

## Release Management

The delivery workflow included:

1. Development changes implemented in Dev environment
2. Testing and validation in UAT environment
3. Approval before production deployment
4. Backup creation before applying changes
5. Post-deployment verification

This ensured safe and predictable deployments.

---

## Backup and Recovery Strategy

Backup procedures covered:

- Application object backups
- Database backups
- Configuration snapshots
- Scheduled backup verification

These backups enabled rollback and recovery in case of issues during deployment or operations.

---

## Developer Support and Collaboration

Operational support included:

- Environment preparation for development teams
- Troubleshooting deployment issues
- Coordinating integration testing
- Supporting vendor interactions
- Managing system access and permissions

This enabled efficient development workflows across teams.

---

## Incident Handling and Support

Platform operations included:

- Production issue diagnosis and resolution
- Performance troubleshooting
- Environment restoration when required
- Monitoring system health indicators
- Coordinating with stakeholders during incidents

The focus was maintaining uptime and service reliability.

---

## Technologies and Systems

- Microsoft Dynamics NAV / Business Central
- Windows Server environments
- SQL databases
- Cloud and hybrid infrastructure
- Identity and access systems
- Backup and recovery tools

---

## Key Engineering Outcomes

- Improved deployment reliability
- Reduced production risks
- Structured development lifecycle
- Faster issue resolution
- Better collaboration between teams
- Increased operational stability
